# VISUALISATION: be aware that perturbations will not show up in the species dispersal time series, and that a full
# iteration will also occur before the recording of data, so that isolated impact of the perturbation alone will never
# be visible. You will instead observe the normally-indexed time-series, and note that part of the TS change was due
# to perturbation during the time-step, in addition to subsequent reproduction, dispersal, etc.
#
# To include:
#
#   - Program the recording, analysis and visualisation of the impact of perturbations of all kinds.
#       - save the simulation in a reloadable state prior to the perturbation
#       - [X] visualisations before and after the perturbation
#       - [X] visualisation of the change
#       - how does the change compare to average change per iteration prior to the perturbation?
#
#   - Spatial network connectivity:
#       - Adding wildlife corridors or removing existing connections.
#   - Patch quality (affecting all patches globally):
#       - Seasonal variation.
#       - Stochastic variation due to bad winters.
#   - Habitat types (pass in a list of patches to alter):
#       - Specified changes in the nature recovery plan.
#       - Climate change and gradual gradient change to habitat types.
#       - Periodic variation due to crop rotation (periodic and random timing; fixed or random cycle of habitat types).
#       - Flooding (sudden, rapid change to habitat types of set duration).
# 	- Cold snap impacting reproductive rates, mortality, carrying capacity and patch quality (e.g. could reduce all
# 	     patch quality, but freeze waterways making them traversable to terrestrial species, for a set number of days)
# 	     - This would be implemented as two sets of two perturbations, the first time reducing patch quality and
# 	     changing to ``frozen'' habitat type which would need to already exist in the set with appropriate traversal
# 	     scores for each species. The second would then reverse both of these effects to the original quality and
# 	     habitat types.
#   - Note that change_patch_parameter() can apply to either quality (thus, reproductive rate) or size for implementing
#        either patch degradation or restoration (impacting carrying capacity) as parts of the same connected patch
#        become less or more usable by residents.
